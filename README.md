# AGS History Extractor

This tool unarchives multiple AGS release archives and pulls out demo and template data, in order to produce a rough
history in a git repository.

## Use

 * Place zip files into data/
 * Edit order.txt to determine order to load zip files.
 * Run ./process.py

## Sourcing Releases

AGS releases have been archived all over the place. I sourced from:
